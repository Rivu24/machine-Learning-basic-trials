# machine-Learning-basic-trials
This GitHub repository is a collection of my personal practice and projects related to AI and Machine Learning.
 The repository contains several folders, each of which represents a project or a set of related practice exercises.  The projects and practice exercises cover a variety of topics in AI and Machine Learning, including data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. The projects are implemented in Python and use popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and NLTK.  Each project folder contains a README file that provides a brief description of the project and its goals. The README file also includes information on how to set up the project and run the code. The code files are organized into separate folders based on their functionality, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  In addition to the project folders, the repository also contains a folder for miscellaneous practice exercises that cover various AI and Machine Learning topics.  The repository serves as a record of my personal learning and growth in AI and Machine Learning. I hope that it can also serve as a resource and inspiration for others who are interested in these fields.
