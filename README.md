# machine-Learning-basic-trials
This GitHub repository is a collection of my personal practice and projects related to AI and Machine Learning.
 The repository contains several folders, each of which represents a project or a set of related practice exercises.  The projects and practice exercises cover a variety of topics in AI and Machine Learning, including data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning. The projects are implemented in Python and use popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras, and NLTK.  Each project folder contains a README file that provides a brief description of the project and its goals. The README file also includes information on how to set up the project and run the code. The code files are organized into separate folders based on their functionality, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.  In addition to the project folders, the repository also contains a folder for miscellaneous practice exercises that cover various AI and Machine Learning topics.  The repository serves as a record of my personal learning and growth in AI and Machine Learning. I hope that it can also serve as a resource and inspiration for others who are interested in these fields.

## Project Description
This project involves analyzing two datasets related to startup companies. The first dataset, 50_startups.csv, is the raw dataset containing information about 50 startup companies. The second dataset, cleaned_startups.csv, is a cleaned version of the raw dataset that has been preprocessed and is ready for analysis.

The project also includes a Jupyter notebook file named Code.ipynb, which contains all the code used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. The notebook file includes both the input code and the output results.

## Dataset Description
Raw Dataset
The 50_startups.csv dataset contains information about 50 startup companies. The dataset includes the following columns:

- R&D Spend: the amount of money spent on research and development.
- Administration: the amount of money spent on administration.
- Marketing Spend: the amount of money spent on marketing.
- State: the state where the company is located.
- Profit: the profit made by the company.
- Cleaned Dataset
The cleaned_startups.csv dataset is a cleaned version of the 50_startups.csv dataset. The dataset has been preprocessed to remove any missing or duplicate values, and to encode categorical variables. The dataset includes the following columns:

- R&D Spend: the amount of money spent on research and development.
- Administration: the amount of money spent on administration.
- Marketing Spend: the amount of money spent on marketing.
- State: the state where the company is located.
- Profit: the profit made by the company.
## Jupyter Notebook
The Code.ipynb Jupyter notebook file contains all the code used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis. The notebook file includes the following sections:

+ Data loading and exploration
+ Data cleaning and preprocessing
+ Exploratory data analysis
+ Model training and evaluation
The notebook file includes both the input code and the output results, and is designed to be easy to read and understand. Each section is clearly labeled and includes comments explaining the code and the thought process behind it.

## Method
This project involves comparing the performance of four machine learning models on a given dataset. The models are multiple linear regression, KNN regression, Lasso regression, and Ridge regression. The project aims to analyze the R2 value of each model and determine which model performs the best.

The project also includes a Jupyter notebook file named Code.ipynb, which contains all the code used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and model training. The notebook file includes both the input code and the output results.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comparison of the performance of four machine learning models on a given dataset. The project shows how to load, clean, preprocess, train, and evaluate the models. The project also includes a comparison of the R2 values of each model, which helps determine which model performs the best. The Jupyter notebook file can be used as a template for similar analyses or as a reference for those interested in learning more about machine learning.
